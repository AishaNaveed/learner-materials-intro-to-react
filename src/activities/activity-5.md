# Activity 5

Our `App.js` file is looking more and more like a React project should look!

Both our navbar and header have been stripped out into re-usable components and so has our Cindy Clawford cat card. 

Great work - you're getting the hang of this! ðŸ™Œ

If you came into any trouble or would like to double check your code, you can see an example solution [here](https://github.com/techreturners/learner-materials-intro-to-react/tree/activity-4-example-solution)

Using what you've learnt about creating components and importing them into `App.js`, create components for:

- Little Miss Purrfect cat card
- El Taco cat card
- My Gwumpy cat card
- Footer

When you've done that you can move to the extension [Activity 6](./activity-6.md)
