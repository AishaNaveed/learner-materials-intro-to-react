# Activity 3

In the `components` folder you created earlier create another file called `Header.js`

Inside of this file type:

```
function Header() {
    return (

    )
}

export default Header;
```

In App.js copy and paste our `h1` and surrounding `header` element into our new `Header.js` component file (after the return statement, between the braces)

Save `Header.js`

At the top of  `App.js` import out new Header component:

`import Header from './components/Header'`

Delete our original `<header>` and `<h1>`, replacing them with our new header component:

`<Header/>`

Save `App.js`

Check the browser

Our app should still work and look the same.. but now our Header code has become a re-usable component! ðŸ¥³
